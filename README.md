\# Cloud Program Tracker \& Risk Dashboard



This repository represents how I would track cross-functional cloud initiatives as a Technical Program Manager, focusing on clarity, risk visibility, and execution.


\## What this demonstrates

\- Program tracking across workstreams (status, owners, deadlines)

\- Risk management with severity and mitigation plans

\- Dependency tracking to identify blockers and timeline risk

\- TPM-style status reporting and clear documentation



\## Repo structure

\- `/data` — fictional initiative, risk, and dependency datasets

\- `/sql` — schema and reporting queries

\- `/analysis` — synthesized TPM status snapshot



\## Status reporting

Program health and risk summaries are derived from SQL queries in `/sql/queries.sql` and summarized in `/analysis/insights.md`.



\## Notes

All data is fictional and does not include any proprietary employer information.
